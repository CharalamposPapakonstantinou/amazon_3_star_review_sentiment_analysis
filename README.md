# Amazon 3 star review using VADER and Streamlit

This app takes a product given by the user as input. It retrieves the first result on Amazon and collects all the 3-star reviews. Language detection is then performed, and text analysis is carried out only on the reviews written in English using VADER. The app determines whether the 3-star reviews are closer to positive or negative ones. It also fetches the bar chart found on Amazon and presents an explanatory polar graph.
